            Cancellable app Terms of Service
            <br><br>
            <strong>Cancellable</strong> "the App” provides order cancellation, edit and reorder on customer facing side "the Service" to merchants who use Shopify to power their stores.
            <br><br>
            When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to <strong>Yagi Software</strong>. 
            <br><br>
            When you use the app, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for all features that we add to our app over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. <strong>These terms do contain a limitation of our liability</strong>.
            <br><br>
            If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us.

            <ol class="list-decimal">
              <li>Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.</li>

            <br>
            <p>
              We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:
              <br><br>
              <span class="font-semibold italic">
              You expressly understand and agree that the Company shall not be liable, in law or in equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits, special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.</span>
              <br><br>
              In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as possible through careful management of the business; investments in infrastructure and in general giving a damn. If you choose to use our Services, thank you for betting on us.
